# MERN Stack Learning Project

This repository contains the code I created while learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It includes both front-end and back-end development as I practiced building full-stack applications with these technologies.

Feel free to explore the code and see my progress!

## Technologies Used
